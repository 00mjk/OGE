# OGE
Open Guerrilla Editor. An open source modding tool for Red Faction Guerrilla. Still in it's very early stages. The current goal is to make a comprehensive modding tool for RFG that automates some things that people used to do by hand such as updating asm_pc files, and eliminates the need for multiple command line tools. As it's expanded some existing tools like the [new texture editor](https://github.com/Moneyl/RFG-Texture-Editor-Redux) will likely be merged with this tool since there are some convenience features that can be provided by having both tools in one program.

On the left is the file explorer for the working directory, in the center is the texture viewer, with a tab visible for a lua ui file.
